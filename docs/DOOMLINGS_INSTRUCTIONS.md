# Doomlings - Complete Game Rules

## Overview

**Doomlings** is a card game about surviving the end of the world! Players compete to score the most points by playing trait cards before three catastrophes bring about the World's End.

| Players | Age | Play Time |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| 2-6 | 10+ | 20-45 minutes |

### Objective

Score the most points by the end of the world. Players build trait piles by playing cards on their turns. When the third and final catastrophe occurs, the game ends and scores are tallied. The player with the highest score wins.

---

## Components

- **Trait Cards** - The main deck. Players draw and play these to build their trait piles.
- **Age Cards** (25) - Represent different eras. Each round, a new age is revealed with rules that affect that round.
- **Catastrophe Cards** (15, use 3 per game) - Major extinction events. Three catastrophes end the game.
- **Birth of Life Card** (1) - Special starting age that begins every game.
- **Gene Pool Cards** (1 per player) - Track each player's hand size (values 1-8).

---

## Setup

### 1. Prepare the Age Deck

1. **Separate** the Birth of Life card and all Catastrophe cards from the Age cards
2. **Shuffle** the 25 Age cards
3. **Divide** the shuffled Age cards into **3 roughly equal piles**, face down
4. **Shuffle** the Catastrophe cards, then deal **1 random Catastrophe** into each of the 3 piles
5. **Shuffle each pile** individually (each pile now has ~8-9 Ages + 1 Catastrophe)
6. **Stack** the 3 piles on top of each other to form the Age deck
7. **Place Birth of Life** on top of the completed Age deck
8. Place the Age deck face down in the center of the table

### 2. Prepare the Trait Deck

1. Shuffle all Trait cards
2. Place face down next to the Age deck
3. Leave space for a discard pile

### 3. Set Up Players

1. Each player takes a **Gene Pool card** and places it with **5** facing up
2. Deal **5 Trait cards** to each player (this is their starting hand)
3. Determine the first player (left of the dealer)

---

## Gene Pool

Your Gene Pool card represents your **target hand size**. After you stabilize at the end of your turn, your hand must equal your Gene Pool number.

### Gene Pool Rules

- Gene Pool can range from **1 to 8**
- If an effect would push Gene Pool below 1 or above 8, **ignore that effect**
- When your Gene Pool changes, rotate/flip the card to show the new value
- **Do NOT draw or discard** when your Gene Pool changes—only adjust during stabilization

### Exception: Trait Removal

When a trait that modified your Gene Pool **leaves your trait pile** (discarded, stolen, etc.), you **must** adjust your Gene Pool back, even if this would exceed 8 or go below 1. The event of leaving causes the change.

---

## Gameplay

### Starting the Game

1. The first player flips the Birth of Life card from the Age deck
2. All players apply the Birth of Life effects (typically sets Gene Pool to 5 and draws starting hands)
3. Moving **clockwise**, each player takes a turn
4. After all players have taken a turn, the first player flips the next Age card
5. A new round begins

### Round Structure

1. **Reveal Age** - First player flips the top Age card
2. **Apply Age Effect** - All players follow the Age's rules **before** any turns are taken
3. **Player Turns** - Each player takes one turn (clockwise from first player)
4. **Next Round** - After all turns, reveal the next Age card

**Important:** Age effects last for **1 round only** (except Gene Pool modifications, which are permanent).

---

## Taking a Turn

### 1. Play a Trait

Play **1 trait card** from your hand, face up, in front of you. This is your **trait pile**—how you earn points.

**You MUST play a trait if you are able**, even if it's not beneficial for your pile.

### 2. Follow Effects

If your played trait has text at the bottom (an effect), follow those instructions now.

- **Actions** (marked with action symbol) - Occur once, when played directly from your hand
- **Trait Effects** - Apply as long as the trait remains in your pile

### 3. Stabilize

To end your turn, **stabilize** by drawing or discarding until your hand equals your Gene Pool number.

**Examples:**
- Gene Pool is 5, you hold 4 cards → Draw 1
- Gene Pool is 5, you hold 6 cards → Discard 1
- Gene Pool is 5, you hold 5 cards → Do nothing

**Notes:**
- Throughout the game, you may temporarily have more or fewer cards than your Gene Pool—that's okay
- Only adjust your hand during stabilization
- Some effects can force you to stabilize out of turn, or skip stabilization entirely

### Your Turn is Over

Once you're stable, your turn ends. Play continues clockwise.

---

## When You Can't Play a Trait

### Hand is Empty

If your hand is empty at the start of your turn:
- **Draw 5 cards**
- **Skip your turn** (do not play a trait)
- **Do not stabilize** this turn

### Have Cards But Can't Play Any

If you hold cards but none can be legally played (due to Age restrictions or requirements):
- **Skip your turn**
- **Do not stabilize** this turn

### Optional: Discard and Draw

At any time when you cannot play, you may choose to:
- **Discard your entire hand**
- **Draw 3 cards**
- **Skip your turn**
- **Do not stabilize** this turn

**Tip:** Grow your Gene Pool to avoid getting stuck with an empty hand!

## Ages

Age cards represent different periods in the world's history. Each Age has effects that modify gameplay for that round.

### How Ages Work

1. First player reveals the top Age card at the start of each round
2. **All players** follow the Age effect **before** any turns are taken
3. Age effects last for **that round only**
4. After all players have taken turns, a new Age is revealed

### Types of Age Effects

| Effect Type | Duration | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Restrictions** | 1 round | "Cannot play Blue traits this round" |
| **Bonuses** | 1 round | "All players draw 2 cards" |
| **Gene Pool Changes** | Permanent | "+1 Gene Pool" (lasts rest of game) |
| **Rule Modifications** | 1 round | "Action effects are ignored this round" |

---

## Catastrophes

Catastrophes are major extinction events shuffled into the Age deck. **Drawing the 3rd Catastrophe ends the game.**

### When a Catastrophe is Revealed

1. **First player moves** - The first player marker passes 1 position to the left
2. **Gene Pool Effect** - All players **permanently** apply the Gene Pool change (e.g., "-1 Gene Pool")
3. **Catastrophic Effect** - All players follow the secondary effect (e.g., "Discard 1 card per Red trait")
4. **World's End Effect** - **IGNORE** this until the 3rd catastrophe

### After a Catastrophe

- The round ends immediately (no player turns this round)
- A new round begins with the next Age card
- First player is now the player to the left of the previous first player

### The Three Effects Explained

| Effect | When Applied | Duration |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Gene Pool Effect** | Every catastrophe | Permanent |
| **Catastrophic Effect** | Every catastrophe | Immediate, one-time |
| **World's End Effect** | 3rd catastrophe only | Applied during final scoring |

---

## World's End

When the **3rd and final Catastrophe** is drawn, the game ends. No more turns are taken. It's time to score.

### World's End Resolution Order

#### 1. Apply Final Catastrophe

Apply the Gene Pool Effect and Catastrophic Effect of the final catastrophe, just like the previous two.

#### 2. Resolve Trait World's End Effects

**In turn order** (starting from current first player), each player checks their trait pile for traits with the **World's End symbol** (gold text in bottom corner).

Resolve these effects now, in turn order.

#### 3. Apply Catastrophe World's End Effect

Finally, apply the **World's End Effect** from the final Catastrophe card. This typically affects all players' scores.

#### 4. Proceed to Scoring

---

## Scoring

### Step 1: Final Catastrophe World's End

If the final Catastrophe's World's End effect gives or takes away points, calculate those now.

### Step 2: Tally Face Values

Add up the **face value** (number at bottom) of all traits in your trait pile.

- **Compass star symbols** (variable value) count as **zero** for face value
- Negative face values subtract from your total

### Step 3: Calculate Bonuses

Add up all **bonuses and modifiers** from traits with the **Drop of Life symbol** (bottom right corner).

These are calculated based on game state:
- "+1 per Blue trait you have"
- "+2 for each Dominant in your hand"
- "Points equal to your Gene Pool"
- Etc.

### Step 4: Gene Pool Leader Bonus

The player with the **highest Gene Pool** at game end receives **+3 points**.

If tied for highest, no one receives the bonus.

### Final Score

**Final Score = Face Values + Bonuses + World's End Modifiers + Gene Pool Leader Bonus**

### Tiebreaker

If players are tied:
1. Draw a trait from the top of the deck
2. Apply **only the face value** to your final score
3. Highest score wins

---

## Dominant Traits

Dominant traits are powerful cards with **gold borders** and a **gold star** in the top corner.

### Dominant Protection

Once played, Dominant traits **cannot be**:
- Stolen
- Swapped
- Discarded by opponents
- Returned to hand
- Removed from your trait pile for any reason

**Choose wisely—they're permanent!**

### Dominant Limit

You may only have **2 Dominant traits** in your trait pile.

### Getting a 3rd Dominant

If you would receive a 3rd Dominant by random chance (e.g., playing from top of deck):
- **Discard it immediately**
- You may **not** redraw to replace it

### Exception: Birth of a Hero

The Age card "Birth of a Hero" commands players to play "Heroic" (a Dominant) immediately. If this would be your 3rd Dominant, **you may keep it**.

This is **THE ONLY WAY** to have 3 Dominant traits in your pile.

## Effects Guide

### Effect Types

| Type | Location | When It Applies |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Effectless** | No text | Just face value, no special rules |
| **Action** | Action symbol + text | Once, when played from hand |
| **Trait Effect** | Text, no action symbol | While trait is in your pile |
| **Age Effect** | On Age cards | During that round only |

### Actions (Action Symbol)

Actions are special effects that trigger **once**, when the trait is played **directly from your hand**.

**Important Action Rules:**
- If you cannot perform the action, you **must still play the trait**—just ignore the action
- By default, **do not** trigger actions when a trait is:
  - Played from the discard pile
  - Stolen or swapped into your pile
  - Played from the top of the deck
  - Played by any means other than directly from your hand

Unless the card specifically says otherwise.

### Trait Effects (+/- Gene Pool)

Traits that modify Gene Pool (e.g., "+1 Gene Pool") take effect as long as they're in your trait pile.

- When played: Apply the Gene Pool change
- When removed: **Reverse** the Gene Pool change

### Out-of-Turn Traits (Special Symbol)

Some traits can be played **outside your normal turn**. Look for the out-of-turn symbol.

- If played as instructed (out of turn), it **does not count** as your turn
- **Do not stabilize** until the end of your actual turn
- These traits **can** still be played as a normal turn, but this is usually not recommended

---

## Requirements and Restrictions

### Requirements

Some traits have requirements like: *"To play, you must have at least 1 Colorless trait in your trait pile."*

- You must fulfill the requirement to play the card from your hand
- If a trait enters your pile randomly (stolen, from deck) and you don't meet the requirement, **discard it immediately**
- If a trait is **moved, swapped, or stolen** into your pile, **ignore the requirement** unless otherwise stated

### Restrictions

Age cards can create restrictions like: *"Players cannot discard this round."*

- If a trait requires you to do something restricted, **play the trait anyway** and ignore the restricted part of the effect
- This might even work to your advantage!

## Colors

### The Five Colors

| Color | Border Color |
|-------|--------------|
| **Red** | Red |
| **Blue** | Blue |
| **Green** | Green |
| **Purple** | Purple |
| **Colorless** | Grey |

### Important Color Rules

- **Colorless** is grey and is **not** counted for "color" designated effects
- **Dual-color** cards (expansion content) have borders with 2 colors and count as both colors simultaneously
- **"Lowest/highest color count"** = the color you have the least/most of
- **"A color pair"** or **"pair of colors"** = 2 traits of the same color

---

## Additional Rules

### Face Value

The number at the bottom of a trait card. This value is **constant** and doesn't change during the game.

- **Compass star** (variable value) symbols always count as **zero** for face value
- Bonuses are calculated separately, not as face value

### Swapping and Stealing

- If you **swap/steal from a hand**, the card goes into **your hand**
- If you **swap/steal from a trait pile**, the card goes into **your trait pile**

### Randomized Removal

If a trait must be randomly removed from someone's hand or pile:
1. Have them flip their cards face down
2. Offer to an opponent to select
3. (Or use another fair random method)

### Discard Pile

- Discard face up, next to the Trait deck
- Only reshuffle the discard pile if the Trait deck runs out

### Disputes

If rules conflict, follow this hierarchy:
1. **Age cards** (highest priority)
2. **Trait cards**
3. **Survival guide / base rules** (lowest priority)

---

## Quick Reference

### Turn Order
1. Play 1 trait (mandatory if able)
2. Follow effects
3. Stabilize (draw/discard to Gene Pool)

### Catastrophe Order
1. First player moves left
2. Apply Gene Pool effect (permanent)
3. Apply Catastrophic effect (immediate)
4. Ignore World's End until 3rd catastrophe

### World's End Order
1. Apply final Catastrophe's Gene Pool + Catastrophic effects
2. Resolve trait World's End effects (in turn order)
3. Apply final Catastrophe's World's End effect
4. Score

### Scoring Formula
```
Face Values + Bonuses + World's End Modifiers + Gene Pool Leader Bonus (+3)
```

### Gene Pool
- Range: 1-8
- Ignore effects that would exceed range
- Exception: Trait removal always adjusts Gene Pool

### Dominant Traits
- Gold border, gold star
- Cannot be removed once played
- Maximum 2 per player (exception: Birth of a Hero)
