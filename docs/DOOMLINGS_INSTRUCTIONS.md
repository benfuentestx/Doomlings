## Objective

## Setup

1. **Prepare the Age Deck:**

## Gameplay

### Playing Traits

On your turn, you must play 1 trait from your hand face up in front of you. This creates your **trait pile**, which is how you earn points.

**Important Rule:** If you are able to play a trait, you MUST play a trait, even if that trait isn't beneficial for your trait pile.

### Turn Structure

Players take turns playing traits and following the instructions on the cards. The game progresses through different Ages as Age cards are revealed from the Age deck.

### Age Cards

Age cards represent different periods in the world's timeline and may have special effects or rules that apply while they are in play.

### Catastrophes

Throughout the game, three Catastrophe cards will be revealed at different points. These are major events that affect gameplay and signal the progression toward the end of the world.

## Winning the Game

Once the third and final Catastrophe occurs, the game draws to a close. Players count up their points from their trait piles, and **the player with the most points becomes the victor**.
